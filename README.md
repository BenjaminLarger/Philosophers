## üçΩÔ∏è The Dining Philosophers Problem

The Dining Philosophers Problem is a classic synchronization problem in computer science, illustrating issues that can arise in concurrent programming. In this scenario, a group of philosophers sit around a dining table with a bowl of spaghetti. Each philosopher alternates between thinking and eating. However, they must share a limited number of chopsticks between them, which can lead to deadlock if not properly managed.

The challenge lies in designing a solution that prevents deadlocks, starvation, and ensures that each philosopher can eat without causing conflicts with their neighbors.

## Race conditions
Race conditions occur in concurrent programs when the outcome of the program depends on the relative timing of operations performed by multiple threads or processes. Here's a breakdown:

Concurrency: Race conditions arise in concurrent programs where multiple threads or processes are executing simultaneously.

Shared Resources: Race conditions typically involve shared resources, such as variables, data structures, or files, that are accessed and modified by multiple threads or processes concurrently.

Non-Determinism: The behavior of the program becomes non-deterministic, meaning it can produce different outcomes depending on the specific timing of operations performed by each thread or process.

Undesirable Results: Race conditions can lead to unexpected and erroneous behavior, including data corruption, incorrect calculations, or program crashes.

# FUNCTIONS

## pthread_create:
This function is used to create a new thread.
Its prototype is int pthread_create(pthread_t *thread, const pthread_attr_t *attr, void *(*start_routine) (void *), void *arg);.
thread: A pointer to a variable of type pthread_t where the thread ID will be stored.
attr: An optional pointer to a pthread_attr_t structure containing attributes for the thread (can be set to NULL for default attributes).
start_routine: A pointer to the function the thread will execute.
arg: An optional pointer to arguments that will be passed to the start_routine function.
Example: pthread_create(&thread_id, NULL, philosopher_function, &philosopher_args);

## pthread_join:
This function is used to wait for a thread to terminate.
Its prototype is int pthread_join(pthread_t thread, void **retval);.
thread: The thread ID of the thread you want to wait for.
retval: A pointer to a location where the return value of the thread will be stored (can be set to NULL if not needed).
Example: pthread_join(thread_id, NULL);

## pthread_mutex_init:
This function is used to initialize a mutex (mutual exclusion) object.
Its prototype is int pthread_mutex_init(pthread_mutex_t *mutex, const pthread_mutexattr_t *attr);.
mutex: A pointer to a pthread_mutex_t variable that will hold the mutex object.
attr: An optional pointer to a pthread_mutexattr_t structure containing attributes for the mutex (can be set to NULL for default attributes).
Example: pthread_mutex_t my_mutex; pthread_mutex_init(&my_mutex, NULL);

## pthread_mutex_destroy:
This function is used to destroy a mutex object, releasing any resources associated with it.
Its prototype is int pthread_mutex_destroy(pthread_mutex_t *mutex);.
mutex: A pointer to the mutex object to be destroyed.
Example: pthread_mutex_destroy(&my_mutex);

## pthread_mutex_lock:
This function is used to acquire a lock on a mutex, blocking the calling thread if the mutex is already locked by another thread.
Its prototype is int pthread_mutex_lock(pthread_mutex_t *mutex);.
mutex: A pointer to the mutex object to be locked.
Example: pthread_mutex_lock(&my_mutex);

## pthread_mutex_unlock:
This function is used to release a lock on a mutex, allowing other threads to acquire the mutex.
Its prototype is int pthread_mutex_unlock(pthread_mutex_t *mutex);.
mutex: A pointer to the mutex object to be unlocked.
Example: pthread_mutex_unlock(&my_mutex);

## pthread_detach:
This function is used to detach a thread, allowing its resources to be automatically released when the thread exits.
Its prototype is int pthread_detach(pthread_t thread);.
thread: The thread ID of the thread to be detached.
Example: pthread_detach(thread_id);

## usleep:
The usleep function is used to suspend the execution of the calling thread for a specified number of microseconds.
Its prototype is int usleep(useconds_t microseconds);.
microseconds: The number of microseconds to sleep.
Example: usleep(500000); // Sleep for 500,000 microseconds (0.5 seconds).

## gettimeofday:
The gettimeofday function is used to retrieve the current time as a struct timeval structure, which includes seconds and microseconds since the Unix epoch.
Its prototype is int gettimeofday(struct timeval *tv, struct timezone *tz);.
tv: A pointer to a struct timeval structure where the current time will be stored.
tz: A pointer to a struct timezone structure (deprecated and should be set to NULL).
